## In flight — read before starting

**The designer-UI migration is live.** The package landed 2026-08-04 and is vendored at
`../designer-prototype/` (DP). Read in this order:

1. **`docs/redesign-migration-plan.md`** — the **plan of record**. §1 is what was decided and
   why; §2 is scope; §3 is the nine open items; §4 is the phase/slice order. R-1…R-9 and the
   S1–S20 spec differences are **answered here** — earlier documents state them as open.
2. **`docs/UI-INTEGRATION-HANDOFF.md`** — still the best orientation to what the gates catch
   and how the three prototypes differ (§0 and §2). Its §5 decision queue is now closed.
3. `docs/redesign-migration-plan-2026-08-01.md` — background and derivation only. Its §9
   (RD contract C1–C8) and §10 (gates G1–G7) remain in force; its judgements do not.

**Where it is up to (2026-08-05).** Phases 0 / 1 / 1.5 / 2a / 2b are done, and Phase 3's first
screen (`/explore/mvs`) has landed. The new UI covers the global shell, `/history`, and
`/explore/mvs`. Next is `/explore/songs`.

R-1 and R-2 are both CLOSED — DP's BEM coexists with Tailwind via cascade layers (an unlayered
rule always beats a layered one), and the SSR-unsafe-read pattern is "SSR-safe constant initial
value + isomorphic `useLayoutEffect`", now applied to both files in the drop that had it.

**Two things block or shape what comes next — read `docs/DESIGNER-TODO.md` A4/A5 before touching
a detail screen:**

- **A5 blocks `/watch`.** DP hides every navbar below 767px and its `MobileHeader` has no back
  control, so migrated detail screens have NO way back on phones. The plan's CH2 claimed the
  opposite; that rationale is corrected in place.
- **A4 is a caution, not just a fix.** Slice 2b moved History's filter tabs into the navbar and
  DP's mobile rule silently deleted them on phones — and the six re-recorded baselines absorbed
  the loss without a single test going red. **Re-recording a visual baseline accepts whatever it
  sees. Behaviour has to be guarded by behaviour tests.**

## Error log (one line per user correction; fold recurring lessons into an AGENTS.md rule)

- 2026-07-21: a large feature commit (auth/i18n/subscriptions, `79eb1b1`) changed `src/` without
  updating AGENTS.md/README/DEVELOPER-HANDOVER/specs — docs drifted. When changing code, update
  the affected docs in the same change.
